    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Chicken salad is any salad with chicken as a main ingredient. Other common ingredients may include mayonnaise, hard-boiled egg, celery, onion, pepper, pickles (or pickle relish) and a variety of mustards.</p>
   <p>In Canada and the United States, "chicken salad" refers to either any salad with chicken, or a specific mixed salad consisting primarily of chopped chicken meat and a binder, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing or cream cheese.[1] Like tuna salad and egg salad, it may be served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or some combination of these[citation needed]. It may also be used for sandwiches. Typically it is made with leftover cooked or canned chicken. It may also refer to a garden salad with fried, grilled, or roasted chicken (usually cut up or diced) on top.</p>
