<h3>Description:</h3>
<p> <strong>Pasta salad</strong>(pasta fredda) is a salad dish prepared with one or more types of pasta, almost always chilled, and most often tossed in a vinegar, oil, or mayonnaise-based dressing. It is typically served as an appetizer, side dish or a main course. Pasta salad is often regarded as a spring or summertime meal, but it can be served any time of year.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong><br>Whilst there is no clear origin for the salad, there are various theories that claim different origins for the salad. Some historians and chefs such as Claudia Roden trace back the origin of pasta salad to Italian Jews in the Roman Empire, who reused cold pasta as Jewish Law prohibited cooking on sabbath.[1] Others date it even further back to the Phoenecians.

    The modern version of pasta salad that uses macaroni noodles dates back to 1914 in an American recipe.</p>
